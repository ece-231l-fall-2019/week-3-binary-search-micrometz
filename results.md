###### Binary vs linear seach

hello this is my result/readme as of right now my program was not able to run but
I was still able to write functions for everything but i was not able to make everything
mesh together yet. But I can still talk about the different between binary and linear.
So the way that everything should work out is that binary is fast than linear which
makes sense to me but if i had to guess that the binary is would be twice as fast.
For each one using pointers is faster than using normal functions.

|           | Binary | Linear |
|-----------|--------|--------|
|  Pointers |--------|--------|
|No Pointers|--------|--------|
